# webapp-skeleton

The non-domain specific parts of a Single Page (web) Application.

It should clearly explain how
* initialization
  * configuration
  * user identification
  * per-user / per-company data shared across modules
* state management
  * global and per-module data caching/refresh
* routing
  * per-module deep link generation
* efficient conditional rendering
* active menu item selection
* responsive layout
all work together.
